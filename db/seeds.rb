# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

User.delete_all()

# u1 = User.new(:email => "amadden80@gmail.com", :password => "password", :password_confirmation => "password", :remember_me => false)

# f1 = Filter.new(:azimuth => -30, :elevation => 0, :ear => 0)
# f2 = Filter.new(:azimuth => 30, :elevation => 0, :ear => 1)

# u1.filters << f1
# u1.filters << f2

# u1.save!
# f1.save!
# f2.save!
